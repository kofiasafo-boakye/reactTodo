# reactTodo
This was my first very simple react project which was a simple todo application.
In this application, on the first open you simply have an input field where you are asked to enter a task to add to your list of things to do.
On submission of the entered task, the item is listed right below the input field for the user to view with two buttons on each task. Each input task is stored on the users local computer using local storage as this project does not make use of any databases like mongo db/firebase.
The first button is a check mark which is basically used to indicate that the task has been completed and when clicked, the listed item is crossed throughout and faded slightly to represent completion of the task.
The other button is a clear button which when clicked, basically clears the item from the list of things to do as the user tries to clear up tasks completed and make way for new entries.
