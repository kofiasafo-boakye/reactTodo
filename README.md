#reactapp
This was my first simple react application. This app is a simple todo application that helps users track what they have planned out to do at a given time.
The application consists of an input bar where a user simply inputs a task they wish to accomplish. 
On submission of the task by the user, the item is stylefully displayed right below the input bar and stored on the users local machine by making use of local storage as this project does not make use of high end databases such as mongo db/ firebase.
Each displayed item has 2 buttons on it.
The first button is a check button which when pressed indicates that the task has been completed and then the item is crossed through with a straight line and slightly faded.
The other button is a clear button which when pressed indicates that the task has been cleared from the system and is therefore no more displayed.
